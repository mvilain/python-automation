# Python Automation Readme.md

forked from https://github.com/ifrankandrade/automation

## Environment
This repo contains the course materials for the FreeCode course on python automation. It uses non-standard libraries (i.e. not usually installed libraries as part of a standard installation). A `requirements.txt` file defines the required libraries to run this code plus the cheat sheet he collects your personal information to obtain via email.

To create the virtual environment to run this code, do the following in a command-line shell
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
